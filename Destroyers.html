  <h1>Destroyers</h1>

  <p>Destroyers played a significant role as fast attack ships during World War II, primarily serving as escort vessels attached to battle groups. With their ability to carry torpedoes and effectively hunt submarines, they were essential assets in naval warfare. However, the landscape of naval tactics and doctrines underwent a substantial transformation with the widespread adoption of modern guided missiles.</p>
  <p>In the immediate post-World War II period, destroyers boasted greater speed than Cruisers, although they were comparatively less armored and equipped with less advanced onboard technology. They relied on escort ships for advanced logistics and tracking capabilities but compensated with enhanced firepower, torpedoes, and anti-submarine mines. Their specific missions during World War II necessitated specialized design and functionality. Destroyers were required to be swift to close in on enemy ships and deliver rapid strikes, resulting in thinner armor plating and a focus on ship-killing weaponry like torpedoes.</p>

<p>The advent of guided missiles has largely rendered armor obsolete, as modern missiles possess the capability to penetrate most conventional armor plating. Consequently, the need for heavily armored warships has diminished. This shift has enabled both destroyers and cruisers to be equipped with comparable equipment and armor, thereby aligning their operational capacities. Modern destroyers continue to fulfill a range of functions as escorts. However, many have evolved into mobile missile platforms, armed with guided missile launchpads. This transformation allows them to serve both offensive and defensive roles, significantly augmenting their capabilities in modern naval warfare.</p>
<h3>Here is an example of a Destroyer</h3>
  <p>USS Cole, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, U.S. Navy, 2000.</p>

   <p>Since 1945 the destroyer’s dual antiaircraft-antisubmarine role continued through the transition to guided missiles. A modern destroyer’s armament consists of surface-to-air missiles, antisubmarine torpedoes, antiship missiles, and one or two main guns of about 100 or 130 mm (4 or 5 inches) in calibre. Many destroyers carry submarine-hunting helicopters, and some U.S. destroyers carry cruise missiles, allowing them to attack targets on land. Modern destroyers displace about 8,000 tons, are capable of speeds of more than 30 knots, and carry crews of about 300.</p>
