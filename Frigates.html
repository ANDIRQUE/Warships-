  <h1>Frigates</h1>
  <img src="frigates-1689010682.webp" alt="" height="300px" width="420px">
  <p>Throughout naval history, the term "frigate" has been applied to various types of ships, encompassing a range of classifications. From traditional sailing vessels with masts to modern guided missile escorts, the concept of a frigate has evolved significantly over time. In the present era, frigates are larger than Corvettes or shore patrol boats but have less armament compared to Destroyers or Cruisers.</p>
  <p>During World War II, frigates played a crucial role as an intermediary between Corvettes and Destroyers/Cruisers. Corvettes lacked the necessary resources to operate effectively in extended open-water missions. Frigates were designed to be faster than corvettes while also possessing sufficient armament for anti-submarine operations. Although they did not have the same firepower as Cruisers or Destroyers, their primary objective was to escort and engage vulnerable submarines that were forced to resurface</p>
  <p>The Oliver Hazard Perry-class warship served as the final active service frigate in the United States Navy (USN). However, all active duty ships of this class were decommissioned in 2015. This decision was prompted by the emergence of a new ship class, known as the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), which assumed the previous roles of frigates. Presently, the USN is exploring a return to the frigate designation through a newly awarded design contract to Fincantieri. This upcoming frigate class is currently referred to as the Constellation class frigate and is expected to enter production and service in the coming years.</p>
  <h3>Here is an example of a frigate</h3>
  <p>Type-54A [China]</p>
   <img src="800px-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" height="300px" width="420px">
   <p>This is a new class of frigates for the Chinese Navy which is being built in large numbers. It is a cost effective 4000 ton multi-role frigate that is designed for escort as well as independent operations. It is outfitted mainly with Russian electronics and weapons, some of which have been substituted with Chinese copies. Although 
   it packs a punch, it lags behind other contemporary frigates mainly in the radar department. Because it is the cheapest modern frigate in production, China is building dozens of them and 24 ships of this class have been built until now with more under construction.</p>
   <p style="font-weight:bold;">Strength: Anti-Air Warfare</p>
   <p>Propulsion: It has a Combined Diesel and Diesel (CODAD) propulsion with 4 Shaanxi diesel engines, each rated at 5700 kW, thus producing a total of 22,800 kW</p>
   <p style="font-weight:bold;">Sensors:</p>
   <p>&middot;  1 E-band Fregat-ME as its primary radar for surface and air search<p>
     <p>&middot; 4 Front Dome fire control radars for HQ-16 SAM</p>
     <p>&middot; 1 Mineral ME radar for guiding the anti-ship missiles</p>
   <p style="font-weight:bold;">Cons:</p>
   <p>&middot; It uses the relatively older Fregat-ME radar for surface and air search as its primary sensor.</p>
   <p>&minus; It has 4 older generation mechanically scanning fire control radars for the SAM, limiting the number of aerial targets engaged simultaneously to 4.</p>
