  <h1>Aircraft carriers</h1>
  <img src="aircraft-carriers-1689010682.webp" alt="" height="300px" width="420px">
<p>The widespread adaptation of aircraft carriers since World War II has brought about a marked transformation in naval warfare. Alongside the introduction of guided missiles, carriers have rendered battleships completely obsolete, exerting dominance over modern navies ever since. Modern carriers are colossal vessels equipped with cutting-edge technology, resembling small floating cities with a crew capacity of approximately 5,000 personnel. Currently, the world's largest carrier is the newly commissioned Gerald R. Ford class, which replaced the long-standing Nimitz class.</p>
<p>The Gerald R. Ford class represents a pinnacle of Carrier engineering, incorporating advanced electronics and modern technology throughout its construction. Unlike its predecessor, the Nimitz, this class does not rely on outdated internal systems like steam lines. By leveraging these advancements, the carriers can achieve equivalent operational capabilities with approximately 500 fewer crew members.</p>
<p>Aircraft carriers today serve a diverse array of missions such as mobile attack and defense platforms, operating various wing groups. Their mobility also places carriers as rapid response forces, capable of swift deployment. Moreover, carriers are frequently called upon for diplomatic endeavors, as few assets demonstrate diplomacy more prominently than a multi-billion dollar floating weapon platform anchored off the coast of a foreign nation. Carriers also play a vital role in disaster relief and humanitarian missions. Their modern capabilities enable them to provide power to affected areas, provide food for thousands, and produce roughly 200,000 gallons of potable water daily. These capabilities make carriers invaluable assets in addressing crises and delivering aid on a global scale.</p>

   <h3>Here is an example of a carrier</h3>
  <p>Queen Elizabeth class, UK</p>
   <img src="HMS-Queen-Elizabeth-735x551.jpg" alt="" height="300px" width="420px">
  <p>Displacing 65,000t, the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers are the biggest warships ever built for the Royal Navy. The first vessel in class, HMS Queen Elizabeth, began her sea trials in June 2017 and was commissioned in December of the same year. The second carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, was commissioned in December 2019</p>
  <p>HMS Queen Elizabeth completed a seven-month maiden operational deployment as the leading vessel of the Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) in December 2021, sailing across three oceans and five seas.</p>
  <p>HMS Prince of Wales served as the NATO command ship throughout the Cold Response exercise held in Norway between March and April 2022.</p>
  <p>The vessels in the Queen Elizabeth class are three times larger than the Invincible class aircraft carriers and can support the embarkation of up to 40 rotary and fixed-wing aircraft. The latest technology and automated systems on board the vessels enable operations with a streamlined crew of 679.</p>
  <p>Each vessel in the class is armed with Phalanx CIWS, 30mm guns and mini-guns for self-defence against asymmetric threats. The aircraft carrier is powered by two Rolls-Royce MT30 gas turbines and four diesel generator sets, providing a total installed power of 109MWe. The propulsion system enables the vessel to sail at a maximum speed of 25kt.</p>
