  <h1>ABOUT WARSHIPS</h1>
  <p>When it comes to technology news, you could say SlashGear has always been ahead of the curve.</p>

<p>Originally launched by Ewdison Then and Vincent Nguyen in 2005 (two years before anyone had heard of an iPhone) as a blog covering the mobile tech industry, the brand quickly made a name for itself with its timely coverage of smartphone news throughout the mid aughts. In the decade that followed, SlashGear continued to grow, expanding its team and editorial coverage to encompassÂ consumer electronics, the automotive industry, entertainment, medicine, science, and gaming.</p>

<p>Today, SlashGear operates under Static Media and reaches over 5 million readers every month, providing trustworthy, daily news and thought-provoking commentary on everything happening in the automotive and technology industry.</p>

<p>We believe our longevity is a testament to our continued goal of serving as the ultimate resource for those who want to stay up to date on the latest and greatest tech on the market. And while we do write about the business end of things, we distinguish ourselves by focusing our coverage on the consumer, keeping practicality in mind as well as the luxury and wow factor that makes each product compelling for users</p>

<p>SlashGear offers detailed reviews of the latest releases in the fast-evolving world of cars and cutting-edge technology. To read our review policy and scoring guidelines, click here.</p>

<p>Our team of expert writers and editors focuses on everything from how fast, far, and fun the newest electric cars can be driven; how family-friendly two- and three-row SUVs and crossovers are; and whether the latest iPhone, Galaxy, or Pixel is worthy of your upgrade. Experienced, pragmatic, and fair, our reviewers consider value and reliability as much as style and bleeding-edge features, so that when it's time to make a purchase you know you're getting the best bang for your buck. In addition to our in-house talent, we work with a stable of subject-matter experts in a variety of technical fields. These expert perspectives help us digest the stories of the day for our readership.</p>

<p>Readers can also count on us to provide in-depth coverage of all major technology and automotive events, from the New York International Auto Show, CES, and Mobile World Congress to the latest Apple launch or Google Pixel reveal.</p>
