  <p>Corvettes are nimble and high-speed vessels frequently employed as coastal patrol boats. While the corvette designation may vary across countries, these ships are typically restricted to operating in close proximity to naval bases and are seldom deployed independently in open water.</p>
  <p>These vessels are renowned for their ability to swiftly respond to threats along a nation's coastlines, making them valuable assets for fast attack and response missions. A significant advantage of corvette-class ships lies in their compact size and exceptional speed. Due to their smaller dimensions, they do not necessitate specialized naval engineering docks like carriers or cruisers. Instead, smaller engineering bays can be utilized, facilitating easier mass production.</p>
  <p>Although the United States Navy (USN) does not presently possess any ships specifically designated as corvettes, there are several smaller ship classes that fall within a similar category. Notably, the larger patrol boats operated by the U.S. Coast Guard exhibit characteristics and capabilities akin to corvettes, even if they lack the specific designation. Additionally, the LCS (Littoral Combat Ship) class of vessels served as a temporary replacement for frigates and corvettes.</p>
  <p>LCS ships can be classified as corvette-style warships as well. Certain newer models of LCS ships were initially intended to succeed frigates, but following field testing, issues including exceeding budgetary limits and failing to deliver promised capabilities emerged. Consequently, the majority of LCS ships were decommissioned, and all future production of this class has been halted.</p>
  <h3>Here is an example of a Corvette</h3>
  <p>Type-54A [China]</p>

   <p>The Norwegian-built Skjold class of naval corvettes is a range of large, superfast attack craft in service with the Royal Norwegian Navy. The Skjold class has been known to reach speeds of up to 60kn in calm sea, using four gas turbines to propel the 47.5m long lightweight attack craft.</p>
   <p>Armed with eight Kongsberg anti-ship missiles (ASMs) equipped with GPS midcourse and a dual-band imaging infrared seeker guidance, the Skjold class also holds an Otobreda Super Rapid multi-role cannon, 2 Browning M2HB heavy machine guns, a Mistral surface-to-air missile, and works with the Protector remote weapon station. It is also protected by the CS-3701 electronic warfare (EW) suite.</p>
