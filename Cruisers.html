  <h1>Cruisers</h1>
  <img src="cruisers-1689010682.webp" alt="" height="300px" width="420px">
  <p>Cruisers are renowned as some of the largest and most heavily armored surface attack ships in modern navies. Their size and armament surpass that of carriers, which primarily rely on aircraft for their weaponry. Following World War II, the line between cruisers and destroyers has blurred significantly. Traditionally, cruisers were characterized by their powerful armor and offensive capabilities. However, with the advent of guided missiles in warfare, heavily armored ships were rendered less relevant. Consequently, cruisers shifted their focus from armor to missile platforms and torpedo launchers. Although today's modern cruisers feature reduced armor, they remain highly lethal vessels. Many of these cruisers are equipped with vertical launch missile systems, a main gun, and various smaller gun placements.</p>
  <p>Present-day cruisers serve vital offensive roles on the battlefield. In addition to their potent offensive capabilities, many modern cruisers have advanced electronic countermeasures and defensive systems, often functioning as ballistic missile defense platforms. Despite evolving over time, cruisers maintain their significance within naval fleets. They continue to be optimized for combat effectiveness and multi-role operations, serving as the backbone of numerous navies worldwide.</p>
  
  <h3>Here is an example of a Cruiser</h3>
  <p>USS Long BeachThe guided-missile cruiser USS Long Beach, the first surface vessel powered by nuclear reactors, 1966.</p>

  <p>The era of big-gun cruisers ended with the completion of ships laid down during World War II. In 1961 the United States commissioned USS Long Beach, the first vessel designed from the keel up as a guided-missile cruiser and the first surface warship to steam under atomic energy. This 14,000-ton ship was followed by a series of nuclear-powered U.S. cruisers that ended, in the 1970s, with the 10,400-ton Virginia class. This class has been supplemented since the 1980s and â€™90s by the 7,400-ton, gas-turbine-powered Ticonderoga cruisers. Both the Virginia and Ticonderoga ships are fitted with a broad array of weaponry, including surface-to-air and antiship missiles, tube-launched and rocket-launched antisubmarine torpedoes, and two 125-mm (5-inch) and two 20-mm (0.75-inch) guns. In addition, they are supplied with Tomahawk cruise missiles, which can be fitted with conventional or nuclear warheads. The Ticonderoga vessels carry two submarine-hunting helicopters, and they are equipped with the extremely sophisticated Aegis radar system for tracking hostile targets and directing missile defense.</p>
